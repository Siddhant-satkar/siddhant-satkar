### :wave: About me

Hi, my name is Siddhant. Since the beginning of 2024 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am  happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself. In the QA position I see the potential to make, at the very least, the digital world more welcoming for every person. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge (and practice!) in this area.
